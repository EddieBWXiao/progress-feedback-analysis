1. For reproducing the statistics: run write_up_preprint.Rmd; this writes into exclu_PSEs.csv;
2. For combining the results from modelling with non-modelling: run analysis_DMprogress_grouplevel.m; this script will write into Exp2_PtpVarTable_full.csv
3. For running the fitting, analysis_fit_DMprogress.m + analysis_DMprogress_BICcomparison(false); these will write into exp2_params.mat and exp2_BICtable.csv
